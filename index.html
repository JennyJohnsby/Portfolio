            I'm a front-end developer living in the unique and breathtaking town
            of Longyearbyen. When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me
            outdoors, exploring the stunning Arctic landscapes that fuel my
            passion for adventure. I love blending my creativity with
            technology, crafting engaging and visually captivating web
            experiences. Whether it's problem-solving in code or capturing the
            beauty of nature, I'm always looking for ways to challenge myself
            and grow. Feel free to explore my work, and don't hesitate to get in

        <p>
          Welcome to my portfolio! Here, you'll find a collection of web
          projects that demonstrate my journey as a front-end developer,
          combining my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create responsive,
          accessible, and engaging websites. Each project in my portfolio
          reflects not just technical skills, but also a dedication to
          delivering a smooth user experience. From designing modern layouts to
          implementing responsive features, I strive to create websites that are
          both functional and visually appealing. Whether it’s a simple blog or
          a complex e-commerce platform, I approach every project with
          enthusiasm and a desire to push my own boundaries. <br />
          I invite you to explore my projects and see how I’ve tackled different
          challenges through code.

            <p>
              For my FED1 exam project, I built a responsive web application for
              Arctic Husky Svalbard, a fictional company based in the Arctic
              that shares adventures with huskies. The goal was to create a
              dynamic blog platform that allows users to browse the latest
              posts, and for the site owner to easily manage content through a
              simple admin interface. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no
              frameworks allowed!), I designed a clean, responsive layout that
              features a blog carousel, a thumbnail grid, and user-friendly
              navigation. The project also includes an owner login system,
              allowing the admin to create, edit, or delete posts with ease.
              From planning to testing, this project was a hands-on challenge,
              bringing all my front-end skills to life – minus the huskies, of
              course

            <p>
              For this project, I was tasked with designing and building a
              responsive website for a fictional Community Science Museum,
              targeting children aged 7-15 and families. The goal was to create
              a visually appealing and engaging site that excites visitors about
              the museum, while maintaining a modern, accessible design. The
              website includes essential pages such as the homepage, contact
              page, exhibitions, contribution page, and a document page
              featuring the museum's privacy policy and terms & conditions. The
              layout is responsive across devices, optimized for mobile, tablet,
              and desktop, ensuring a seamless experience for all users,
              including those with disabilities. To appeal to the younger
              audience without being overly childish, I designed a placeholder
              logo and followed a vibrant, yet professional color scheme. The
              project was developed with semantic HTML, adhering to
              accessibility standards and the CSS DRY principle, without using
              any frameworks or JavaScript. Deliverables included a Figma style
              guide, high-fidelity wireframes, and the fully responsive,
              cross-browser compatible site hosted on GitHub Pages. This project
              allowed me to apply design and development best practices in a
              real-world scenario, creating a user-friendly and educational web
              presence for the museum.

            />
            <p>
              For this project, I created a responsive, modern website for Rainy
              Days, an online webshop specializing in stylish and functional
              rain gear. The goal was to design a user-friendly and accessible
              online store that appeals to customers seeking high-quality
              rainwear, while providing a seamless shopping experience across
              all devices. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I built essential
              pages including the homepage, product listings, product details,
              contact page, and a cart functionality. JavaScript was implemented
              for dynamic features such as interactive product filtering, form
              validation, and a responsive shopping cart, allowing users to add,
              remove, and update items as they shop. Accessibility was a key
              focus, ensuring that the site meets WCAG standards for a wide
              range of users, including those with disabilities. I also
              implemented a placeholder logo and designed a clean, modern UI
              that reflects the brand’s values of quality and durability. The
              layout was designed to be fully responsive, providing an optimal
              shopping experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. To
              follow best practices, the site’s code adhered to the DRY
              principle, and it was thoroughly tested for cross-browser
              compatibility and performance optimization. The final project was
              deployed via GitHub Pages, with supporting materials including a
              Figma style guide, wireframes, and a detailed Kanban board for
              tracking project progress.
