            Welcome to my portfolio! Here, you'll find a collection of web
            projects that demonstrate my journey as a front-end developer,
            combining my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create
            responsive, accessible, and engaging websites. Each project in my
            portfolio reflects not just technical skills, but also a dedication
            to delivering a smooth user experience. From designing modern
            layouts to implementing responsive features, I strive to create
            websites that are both functional and visually appealing. Whether
            it’s a simple blog or a complex e-commerce platform, I approach
            every project with enthusiasm and a desire to push my own
            boundaries. <br />
            I invite you to explore my projects and see how I’ve tackled
            different challenges through code.

          <h2>PROJECT EXAM 1 (2024) - ARCTIC HUSKY SVALBARD</h2>
          <img

          <p>
            For my FED1 exam project, I built a responsive web application for
            Arctic Husky Svalbard, a fictional company based in the Arctic that
            shares adventures with huskies. The goal was to create a dynamic
            blog platform that allows users to browse the latest posts, and for
            the site owner to easily manage content through a simple admin
            interface. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks allowed!),
            I designed a clean, responsive layout that features a blog carousel,
            a thumbnail grid, and user-friendly navigation. The project also
            includes an owner login system, allowing the admin to create, edit,
            or delete posts with ease. From planning to testing, this project
            was a hands-on challenge, bringing all my front-end skills to life –
            minus the huskies, of course

          <h2>SEMESTER PORJECT 1 (2024) - SPITSBERGEN SIENCE MUSEUM</h2>

          <p>
            For this project, I was tasked with designing and building a
            responsive website for a fictional Community Science Museum,
            targeting children aged 7-15 and families. The goal was to create a
            visually appealing and engaging site that excites visitors about the
            museum, while maintaining a modern, accessible design. The website
            includes essential pages such as the homepage, contact page,
            exhibitions, contribution page, and a document page featuring the
            museum's privacy policy and terms & conditions. The layout is
            responsive across devices, optimized for mobile, tablet, and
            desktop, ensuring a seamless experience for all users, including
            those with disabilities. To appeal to the younger audience without
            being overly childish, I designed a placeholder logo and followed a
            vibrant, yet professional color scheme. The project was developed
            with semantic HTML, adhering to accessibility standards and the CSS
            DRY principle, without using any frameworks or JavaScript.
            Deliverables included a Figma style guide, high-fidelity wireframes,
            and the fully responsive, cross-browser compatible site hosted on
            GitHub Pages. This project allowed me to apply design and
            development best practices in a real-world scenario, creating a
            user-friendly and educational web presence for the museum.

          <h2>Cross cours; css, html & JavaScript (2024) - Rainy Days</h2>

          <p>
            For this project, I created a responsive, modern website for Rainy
            Days, an online webshop specializing in stylish and functional rain
            gear. The goal was to design a user-friendly and accessible online
            store that appeals to customers seeking high-quality rainwear, while
            providing a seamless shopping experience across all devices. Using
            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I built essential pages including the
            homepage, product listings, product details, contact page, and a
            cart functionality. JavaScript was implemented for dynamic features
            such as interactive product filtering, form validation, and a
            responsive shopping cart, allowing users to add, remove, and update
            items as they shop. Accessibility was a key focus, ensuring that the
            site meets WCAG standards for a wide range of users, including those
            with disabilities. I also implemented a placeholder logo and
            designed a clean, modern UI that reflects the brand’s values of
            quality and durability. The layout was designed to be fully
            responsive, providing an optimal shopping experience on mobile,
            tablet, and desktop devices. To follow best practices, the site’s
            code adhered to the DRY principle, and it was thoroughly tested for
            cross-browser compatibility and performance optimization. The final
            project was deployed via GitHub Pages, with supporting materials
            including a Figma style guide, wireframes, and a detailed Kanban
            board for tracking project progress.
