            I'm a front-end developer living in the unique and breathtaking town of Longyearbyen.
            When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me outdoors, exploring the stunning Arctic
            landscapes that fuel my passion for adventure. I love blending creativity with
            technology, crafting engaging and visually captivating web experiences. Feel free to
            explore my work, and don't hesitate to get in touch!

            <p>
              For my FED1 exam, I built a responsive blog platform for a fictional husky adventure
              company. Using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I created a dynamic layout with admin
              features for managing posts. This project brought all my front-end skills to life.

            <p>
              I designed a responsive site for a fictional museum targeting children and families.
              The site includes essential pages, accessibility features, and a colorful but
              professional aesthetic—coded using semantic HTML and DRY CSS without frameworks.

        <p>
          I’m a developer passionate about coding, creativity, and continuous learning. My tech
          journey is rooted in artistic interests like books, painting, and music. Today, I blend
